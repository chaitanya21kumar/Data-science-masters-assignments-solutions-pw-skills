    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (response variable) and an independent variable (predictor variable). It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the relationship can be represented by a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a simple linear regression to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet). Here, the dependent variable is the price of the house, and the independent variable is the size of the house. The relationship between the size and price is assumed to be linear, such that the price can be estimated using a straight line equation: price = β₀ + β₁ * size. The coefficients β₀ and β₁ represent the intercept and slope of the line, respectively, which are estimated using the regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression extends the concept of simple linear regression to include multiple independent variables that can potentially influence the dependent variable. It models the relationship between the dependent variable and two or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a multiple linear regression to predict the salary of an employee based on their years of experience, level of education, and age. Here, the dependent variable is the salary, and the independent variables are years of experience, level of education (measured on a numerical scale), and age. The relationship between these variables and salary is assumed to be linear, and the multiple linear regression equation can be written as: salary = β₀ + β₁ * experience + β₂ * education + β₃ * age. The coefficients β₀, β₁, β₂, and β₃ represent the intercept and slopes corresponding to each independent variable, which are estimated through regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is that simple linear regression involves only one independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables."

    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data in order for the results to be reliable and valid. These assumptions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This means that the relationship can be adequately represented by a straight line. To check this assumption, you can create scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable and visually inspect if the data points roughly follow a linear pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations should be independent of each other. In other words, there should be no correlation or dependence between the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values). This assumption can be checked by examining the residuals for any patterns or trends. Autocorrelation plots or Durbin-Watson tests can be used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This assumption implies that the spread of the residuals should be similar throughout the range of predicted values. To check for homoscedasticity, you can plot the residuals against the predicted values and look for any systematic patterns or trends. A scatter plot with evenly distributed residuals around zero indicates homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the interpretation of statistical significance. You can examine the histogram of the residuals or use normality tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots, to assess the normality assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. You can calculate the correlation matrix between the independent variables and look for high correlation coefficients. Additionally, variance inflation factor (VIF) values can be calculated to quantify the degree of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following diagnostic tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual inspection of scatter plots, residual plots, and histograms.\n",

    "Normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots for normality.\n",
    "Calculation of correlation matrix and VIF values for multicollinearity.\n",

    "For example, let's consider a linear regression model that predicts the electricity consumption (dependent variable) based on the outdoor temperature (independent variable). If the intercept is 100, it means that when the outdoor temperature is zero, the model predicts an electricity consumption of 100 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope (β₁): The slope represents the change in the predicted value of the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. It indicates the rate of change in the dependent variable per unit change in the independent variable.\n",

The goal is to find the set of parameter values that minimizes the cost function and provides the best fit to the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Update the parameters: Adjust the parameter values by taking a step proportional to the negative gradients. The learning rate, a hyperparameter, determines the size of the steps taken in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat steps 2-4: Iterate the process by recalculating the cost function, gradients, and updating the parameters until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion is often a maximum number of iterations or when the change in the cost function falls below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent continues to update the parameters iteratively, descending along the slope of the cost function until it reaches a local or global minimum. The specific variant of gradient descent, such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or mini-batch gradient descent, determines the amount of data used in each iteration to compute the cost function and gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, gradient descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used in machine learning to iteratively update the parameters of a model by descending along the negative gradient of the cost function, aiming to find the optimal parameter values that minimize the cost and improve the model's performance."
