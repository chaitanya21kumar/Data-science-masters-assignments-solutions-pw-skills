They provide information about how the data points are distributed around the central tendency measures (such as mean or median). Here's an example to illustrate their usage:\n",

    "Consider the following dataset representing the daily temperatures in degrees Celsius for a week: [28, 30, 29, 31, 27, 29, 32]\n",

    "Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. In this example, the range is 32 - 27 = 5 degrees Celsius. It provides a rough estimate of the spread of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the overall variability in the dataset. To calculate the variance, we first find the mean (28.57 in this case) and then compute the squared differences from the mean for each value, sum them up, and divide by the number of values. The variance for this dataset is approximately 2.95 degrees Celsius squared.\n",

    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the typical or average amount by which each data point deviates from the mean. In this example, the standard deviation is approximately 1.72 degrees Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these measures of dispersion, we can understand the spread of the temperatures in the dataset. The range gives a basic idea of the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures. The variance and standard deviation provide a more precise and standardized measure of the variability, indicating how much the temperatures deviate from the mean temperature."
