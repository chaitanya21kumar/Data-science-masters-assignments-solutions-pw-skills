    "When a file is opened, the operating system allocates system resources to the file handle, including memory, buffer space, and CPU time. If a file is not closed properly, these resources may not be freed up, which can lead to issues such as resource leaks or file corruption. Additionally, some operating systems limit the number of open files that a process can have at any given time, so leaving a file open unnecessarily can prevent other processes from accessing that file.\n",
